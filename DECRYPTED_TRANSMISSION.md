### DECRYPTED MESSAGE CONTENT:

> "This is Alpha Team Leader.
> We have successfully infiltrated the Phishermen network perimeter.
> We found the last evidence needed to bring them down for good.
> It is hidden deep within the Phishermen's HQ.

### ANALYST NOTE:
Alpha Team went radio silent immediately after this burst transmission.
The "Phishermen's HQ" likely refers to the main operational dashboard.
You must check the **source code** of that page to retrieve the artifacts they found.

*End of the road, Agent 47. Expect resistance.*
